## About This Project
This is a very beginner-friendly *Password Manager Simulation* I built using basic Python concepts like:

- Lists
- Loops
- Conditions
- Try-Except
- User Input Handling  

---

## Why I Built This
- I didn't want to just copy code from YouTube or Leetcode.
- I wanted to challenge myself to *think in code*.
- Yes, I know this is not secure at all. No encryption, no hashing.
- But for me → This was logic practice, not security practice (yet).

## Features (Very Basic)
|Feature|What It Does|
|-------|------------|
|Set Password|Adds a password to a list|
|Enter Password|Checks if input matches|
|Change Password|Replaces old password with new|
|Exit|Closes the program|

## What can program do:
1. Set Password
2. Enter Password
3. Change Password
4. Exit

## Sample Flow
- Choose 1 → Set "abc123"
- Choose 2 → Enter "abc123" → "You can Proceed :D"
- Choose 3 → Change Password from "abc123" to "xyz789"
- Choose 4 → Exit

## Errors
- I’m aware there might be errors, like the program mis-handling inputs or crashing in some cases, but I’m not sure of all specifics yet.

## Author
- [Sid.py] ([https://github.com/BscCanCode](https://github.com/BscCanCode))

## Development Notes
- Uses basic Python (while loops, lists, `try-except` for error handling).

- These issues in code reflect my current understanding; I may refine them as I learn.

---

## NOTE
- This README is created with help from an AI chatbot.
- I know code has some errors, but it runs too, the reason I kept it as it is: because I want to show people what I understood and develop a code according to my understanding, as my logic and understanding will develop I may or may not update the code.

## Fun_Fact
- I coded this password manager in a few minutes!
